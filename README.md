# Multivariable Calculus Calculator
As I am taking Multivariable Calculus right now, I figured it would be a fun coding project to parallel my math learning in code.
## Usage
1.  Download or clone the repository to your computer.
2. Navigate to the folder containing **workspace.java** through the command line.
3. Type **javac workspace.java** into the command line and press **enter/return** to run the *Multivariable Calculus Calculator*.
### Note
There is no user input, so the outputs need to be hard coded.
