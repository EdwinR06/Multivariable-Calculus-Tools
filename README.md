# Multivariable Calculus Calculator
As I am taking Multivariable Calculus right now, I figured it would be a fun coding project to parallel my math learning in code.
## Usage
1. Download or clone the repository to your computer.
2. Navigate to the folder containing **Workspace.java** through the command line.
3. Type **javac Workspace.java** into the command line and press **enter/return** to compile the java files. 
4. Then, type **java Workspace.java** and press **enter/return** to run the *Multivariable Calculus Calculator*.
### Note
There is no user input, so the outputs need to be hard coded.
